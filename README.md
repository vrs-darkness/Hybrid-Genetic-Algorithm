# Hybrid-Genetic-Algorithm

For Making this Algorithm from Scratch i made use the the attached Research Papers.

So as to solve Travelling salesman Problem, I used up simple vanilla GA initialy. But did i knew about the solution accuracy it provides. There were many instances during my study on GA with regards to solving the TSP kind problem . The algorithm usually gets stuck at local Minima. That's when i came to know about HGA where in it uses up The Same GA algorithm with an additional local search techinque to improvise the offsprings. Few reseaerch papers recommended me to use up techinques like HillClimbing and so on.

Simulated Annealing is a techique that was used to sove TSP problems along with other things like Evolutionary Algorithms etc.. Using this techinque in place of Hill Climbing , i felt would be a great alternative. 


To breif about the coding part there are separate fucnctions that perform each individual tasks Such as Mutate(), CrossOver(), Simulated_annealing(). Each function perform the function as the name suggest. 

I don't have a computing power to run over 10,000 iteration of the my_kernel() fucntion. It took me around an hour to run for 1000 iterations iteself.You can alter it if you want to...

If you wanna learn about the Simulated Annealing Techique in detail (additional link is below) :

Thank you !!
Happy Learning..
